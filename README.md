# Hi, I'm Nick 👋

I build high-leverage products at the intersection of **AI, data platforms, and complex systems**.

Most of my work is hands-on: shaping product strategy, simplifying messy systems, and partnering deeply with engineers to ship scalable solutions in real-world, high-stakes environments.

## 🚀 What I’m Focused On

- 🧠 **AI + Product Systems**: Agent workflows, LLM-enabled products, and applied AI in enterprise environments  
- 🏗️ **Platform Products**: Designing systems that scale across teams, stakeholders, and integrations  
- 🔗 **Data & Integration Simplification**: Reducing complexity across deeply connected ecosystems  
- ⚙️ **Developer-Centric Product Thinking**: APIs as products, clean abstractions, and system usability  
- 📈 **Outcome-Driven Execution**: Shipping measurable improvements (speed, quality, cost, risk)
